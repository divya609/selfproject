**3. Automating with Flows**

Business Requirement for Opportunity Stage Change Notification Flow

Title: Opportunity Re-Engagement Notification

Business Need/Opportunity:
The sales team requires immediate updates when opportunities revert to the "Prospecting" stage. This alert is critical to enable prompt re-engagement strategies, ensuring that opportunities are actively managed and progressed through the sales pipeline.

Requirement:
Developed an automated mechanism within the Salesforce CRM that triggers a notification to the assigned sales representative and/or sales manager whenever an Opportunity record's StageName changes from any given stage back to "Prospecting."

Trigger on Account to assign agents : Populates Agents to Account(property) based on agent specialization and availability.

**5. Test Classes**

Developed test classes for triggers and Apex Controllers with 100% code coverage.
Created a Test Utility class containing methods to create test data for testing purposes.

**6. Lightning Web Components (LWC)**

The LoanCalculator LWC offers a quick and easy way for Salesforce users to calculate monthly payments on loans, including mortgages, auto, and personal loans. It provides dynamic, real-time calculations using principal amount, interest rate, and loan term inputs, all within the familiar Salesforce UI.
